= The Basics
:experimental:

In this step, you will create a straightforward application serving a `hello` endpoint. To demonstrate dependency injection this endpoint uses a `greeting` bean.

== Explore the IDE

This workshop's IDE is based on Eclipse Che (which is in turn based on MicroSoft VS Code editor).

. Explore the icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You'll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to select them and see what they do:

TIP:  If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.


. Many features of VS Code are accessed via *Command Palette*. You can see a few of the tutorials on the *Get Started* page (e.g. _Login/Provision OpenShift Cluster_, _Create Component from Devfile registries webview_, and others).

TIP: If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on macOS).

== Explore the Project

Let's take a look at the *Explorer* menu on the left hand of the IDE. Your Quarkus project was already imported when the workspace was created. 

// . Open the `pom.xml` in the project root directory. Note the version of the IBM Enterprise Build of Quarkus you will use for the workshop today.

. The project contains:

* The Maven structure
* An `org.acme.people.rest.GreetingResource` resource exposed on `/hello`, along with a simple test
* A landing page that is accessible on `http://localhost:8080` after starting the application
* The application configuration file
* Other source files we'll use later

. Navigate to `src -> main -> java -> org.acme.people.rest` in the project tree and select `GreetingResource.java`.

. This class has a very simple RESTful endpoint definition that returns *hello* to requests on `/hello`.

[source, java]

@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Quarkus REST";
    }
}

[NOTE]
====
Compared to vanilla JAX-RS, with Quarkus there is no need to create an `Application` class. It's supported but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different `Scoped` annotations (`ApplicationScoped`, `RequestScoped`, etc).
