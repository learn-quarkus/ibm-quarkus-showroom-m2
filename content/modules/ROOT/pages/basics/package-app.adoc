== Package the app

Quarkus apps can be packaged as an executable JAR file or a native binary. We'll cover native binaries later, so for now, let's package as an executable JAR.

. In the terminal , run the following Maven command (not in Quarkus Dev Mode):
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

. This produces an executable jar file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory:
+
image::jar.png[jar,400]

+
NOTE: `quarkus-run.jar` - being an executable fast jar. Be aware that it's not an über-jar as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

== Run the executable JAR

. Run the following command in the terminal:
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
java -Dquarkus.http.port=8081 -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----
+
[NOTE]
====
We use `-Dquarkus.http.port=8081` to avoid conflicting with port `8080` used for Live Coding mode
====

. With the app running, open a new terminal window, and ensure the app _is_ running by executing a `curl` command:
+
[source, sh, role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/hello
----

. You should see:
+
```console
Hola from Quarkus REST
```

== Cleanup

Go back to the terminal in which you ran the app with `java -jar` and stop the app by pressing kbd:[CTRL+C]. **Be sure not to close the "Start Live Coding" terminal!**

== Congratulations!

You've learnt how to build a basic app, package it as an executable JAR and start it up very quickly. The JAR file can be used like any other executable JAR file (e.g. running it as-is, packaging as a Linux container, etc.)

In the next step we'll inject a custom bean to showcase Quarkus' CDI capabilities.
