= Dependency Injection
:experimental:

In the previous step you created a basic RESTful Java application with Quarkus. In this step we'll add a custom bean using dependency injection (DI). Quarkus DI solution is based on the http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html[Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java 2.0 specification^].

== Add Custom Bean

Let's modify the application and add a companion bean. 

. In the IDE, right-click on the `org.acme.people.service` package in the project browser and select _New File..._.
+
image::newclass.png[newclass,500]

. Name the file `GreetingService.java`.
+
image::classname.png[classname,400]

. Next, replace the below code into the class:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.service;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingService {

    public String greeting(String name) {
        return "hello " + name;
    }

}
----

. This is an injectable bean that implements a `greeting()` method returning a string `hello <name>` (where `<name>` is a parameter).

. Next, open the existing `GreetingResource.java` file (in the `org.acme.people.rest` package) and add a new field and method above the existing `hello` method:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @Inject
    GreetingService service;

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Path("/greeting/{name}")
    @NonBlocking
    public String greeting(@PathParam("name") String name) {
        return service.greeting(name);
    }
----

. This will cause our new `GreetingResource` class to be instantiated and injected as the `service` field, and then the method `greeting` accesses this service to return the name.

. You will get red error squigglies when you paste this code due to missing import statements:
+
image::importerror.png[error,800]

. Add the necessary imports below the existing `import` statements near the top of the file:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.acme.people.service.GreetingService;
import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If you do not see red squigglies, or you can't make them disappear, try to close the file and re-open it, or reload your web browser.
====

== Inspect the results

. Check that the changes work as expected by accessing the `/hello/greeting/quarkus` with _curl_:
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello/greeting/quarkus
----
+
NOTE: Note we are exercising our new bean using the `/hello/greeting/quarkus` endpoint, and you should see `hello quarkus`. In this case, the hostname is the hostname from the pod the app is running on within Kubernetes and will change later on.


== Congratulations!

It's a familiar CDI-based environment for you Enterprise Java developers out there, with powerful mechanisms to reload your code _as you type_ (or very close to realtime). In the next step, we'll create some tests for our app, which should also be familiar to _all_ developers.
