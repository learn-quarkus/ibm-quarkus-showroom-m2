== Quarkus Dev UI for Testing

Quarkus also provides a new experimental Dev UI, which is available in dev mode (when you start quarkus with mvn quarkus:dev) at `/q/dev` by default. It allows you to quickly visualize all the extensions currently loaded, see their status and go directly to their documentation.

Access the https://kube-admin-quarkus-workshop-index-webpage.{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}/q/dev-ui/[Quarkus Dev UI^]
