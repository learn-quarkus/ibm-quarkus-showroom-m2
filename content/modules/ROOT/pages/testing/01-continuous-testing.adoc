== Starting Continuous Testing

. Go back to the terminal and at the bottom of the screen you should see the following:
+
image::ct-resume.png[testshere, 800]

. Press `r` to initate continuous testing. You should see the status change down the bottom of the screen as they are running, and it should finish with the following error:
+
image::ct-error.png[testshere, 800]

. This is because you changed the greeting in an earlier step. In `GreetingResource`, change `Hola` back to `Hello` (in the `GreetingResource` class) and the tests will run again automatically. 
. Confirm all tests pass in the terminal:
+
[source, none]

. Add a new test to the existing `GreetingResourceTest.java` class under the `// add more tests` marker that tests the `/hello/greeting` endpoint by copying this code below the existing test:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Test
    public void testGreetingEndpoint() {
        given()
          .pathParam("name", "quarkus")
          .when().get("/hello/greeting/{name}")
          .then()
            .statusCode(200)
            .body(startsWith("hello "));
    }
----

. You will see the new test result instantly in the terminal:
